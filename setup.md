# Setup

## Adding the bot to your server

Add the snallabot to your server by clicking [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=970091866450198548&permissions=268438608&scope=bot%20applications.commands).

## Setup your league

This step has to be done every SEASON of your league. Once you reach preseason week 1 you can do this setup again (any number of times after that it wont matter).

### Madden Companion App

Now the bot has been added to your discord server do the following:

1. run `/league_export`, this will give you a URL that will be the export URL. whenever you run this command it will give you the same URL!
2. Open the Madden Companion App
3. Find your league in the app and click on it
4. Navigate to the Export section
5. In the web url box, type in the export URL you were given. I am sorry its so long!! but type carefully :)!!!
6. Check the league info, and weekly stats boxes
7. For export week, export All Weeks (scroll to the bottom of the weeks!)
8. Finally, export! Once it is done, the bot is all setup to use
