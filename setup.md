# Setup

## Adding the bot to your server

Add the snallabot to your server by clicking [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=970091866450198548&permissions=310311726160&scope=bot%20applications.commands).

## Setup your league

This step has to be done every SEASON of your league. Once you reach preseason week 1 you can do this setup again (any number of times after that it wont matter).

### Snallabot Dashboard (easiest)

Once the bot has been added to your discord do the following:

1. Run `/dashboard` to open your snallabot dashboard
2. Follow the directions to connect your league to snallabot. Let me know if you have any issues doing so. [Discord Support Server](https://discord.gg/Dc9pTGg9Hc)
3. Once you reach your dashboard, in the export options `All Weeks` and hit export. It should take a minute but snallabot will retrieve all the info it needs.
4. The bot is all setup to use, follow our [feature setup](feature_setup.md) for more features!

### Madden Companion App

Now the bot has been added to your discord server do the following:

1. run `/league_export`, this will give you a URL that will be the export URL. whenever you run this command it will give you the same URL! For the first time, choose the top url. That will connect your discord server with your madden league. 
2. Open the Madden Companion App
3. Find your league in the app and click on it
4. Navigate to the Export section
5. In the web url box, type in the export URL you were given. You can copy and paste it so you don't have to mess it up.
6. Check the league info, and weekly stats boxes
7. For export week, export every regular season week. You can do this one at a time so you are setup for your entire regular season. Once you reach playoffs, you will have to do each week of the playoffs once you are in the week (as we don't know which teams are in the playoffs until then!)
8. Finally, export! Once it is done, the bot is all setup to use
9. If you want to keep your bot up to date, you will have to manually export every week. You may just use the shorter export url instead for that.
